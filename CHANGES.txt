	- Changed version number

11.0.0.2
	ActionBarProfiles.lua
		- Modified ignoreList

	GUI.lua
		- Commented out code that while it checks to find out how many failures exist in the profile (those not able to be restored when the "Use" button is pressed) instead results in addon 'clicking' the "Use" 
		every time the character pane icon was pressed or when selecting a different profile

	Restore.lua
		- Updated addon:ClearSlot(slot) function to include hearthstone toy ignore when clearing slots and also to not clear random favorite mount button

11.0.0.1 - BETA
 - Massive changes to the SAVE and RESTORE of profiles in updating to 11.0 API coding
 - Added addon tables for proper flow of data between files/functions
 - Update to README (thx sc0ttkclark)
 - Updated TOC
 - Cleaned up code somewhat/Added comments to make future changes easier
 - Changed some coding from self/addon to ABP for functionality purposes

 SPECIFIC FILE CHANGES:
	ActionBarProfiles.lua
		- Added debug for profileName when Saving Profile
		- Added an ignnoreList for spells that won't be removed from action bar on clearing

		API Updates:
		- Update in API from GetSpellInfo to C_Spell.GetSpellInfo
		- Update in API from UnitAura to C_UnitAuras.GetAuraDataByIndex
		
		Testing:
		- Added some testing code to file for purpose of checking new talent restoration/learning methods from pre-DF talents

		Post Alpha Changes:
		- Fixed addon:AreTalentsMatching function to better check talents in the DB profile vs what exist
		- Modification to addon:RestoreTalents(profile, check, cache, res) function to attempt switching a few talents instead of clearing entire talent tree (if this doesn't work, fail safe kicks in allowing full clearing 
		of talent tree and re-learning
		- Added ABP:ActionButtonOverride(profileKey, profileName) function to update your action bars with spells and macros that should've been placed there when addon:RestoreActions(profile, check, cache, res) fires but 
		wasn't due to issues on new coding/API
		- Modified addon:ClearSlot(slot) function to check ignoreList and also to include flyout buttons (if you had 'Call Demon' on your Action Bar this would be removed because it is technically not a spell, but a flyout. 
		This is hopefully a temporary change as I work to make sure that flyouts, pets, items are all properly re-added during the restore action period

	Const.lua
		- Updated download link for add-on (was the old URL for previous iteration)
		- Removed/Commented out duplicate line for Elysian Decree

	Dialogs.lua
		- Commented out line within addon:ShowPopup(id, p1, p2, options) and updated addon:UseProfile(popup.name) functions while testing situation where talents would be restored before pressing 'Yes' when confirmation 
		popup was visible (in the end, running RestoreTalents twice

	GUI.lua
		- Removed declaration of 'i' from frame:Update() function (possibly temporarily)
		- Commented out some code within frame:OnShow() function that was triggering profile "Use" when just selecting the profile (this is bad if you're attempting to save changes to your profile)

	GUISave.lua
		API Update:
		- Update in API from HasPetSpells to C_SpellBook.HasPetSpells

	Restore.lua
		MASSIVE changes to the way that the RestoreActions/RestoreTalents functions operate!

		- Change to way that GetSpecializationInfo is retrieved from API
		- Re-enabled the debug print of specIndex, specID, treeID, configID and currentClassProfile within GetMySpecAndConfig() function

		- Removed declaration of 'index' from addon:SaveBindings(profile) function (possibly temporarily)

10.2.5.3
 - Fixes to talents restoring from profiles (Known Issue: talents swap automatically, when player clicks the Action Bars icon within their Character Panel, to the most applicable talent. If multiple specs within same spec, 
 it will bounce between the two of them when frame is open)

10.2.5.2
 - Fixes to PvP talent restoration (spec/class talent restoration is a known issue)

10.2.5.1
 - Re-release as fan-update
